## Installation

You can install Hypest Dark from within Atom or via the terminal. Once
installed select `Hypest Dark` from the UI Theme selection dropdown in Settings.

You can also install the [paired syntax theme](https://atom.io/themes/hypest-dark-syntax) and then select `Hypest Dark` from the Syntax Theme dropdown.

### From the terminal

`apm i hypest-dark`

### From the web

[Install on Atom.io](https://atom.io/themes/hypest-dark)

## Theme settings

### Vibrancy

Hypest has a built in vibrancy mode to allow parts of the window to become
translucent. Vibrancy is disabled by default.

### Tab close position

The macOS convention for the close icon position in tabs is on the left. If you
prefer Atom's default position you can switch it to display on the right of tabs
instead.

### Hide dock buttons

By default Atom displays buttons to reveal panels from the edges of the window
on hover. You can choose to disable this behavior in Hypest if you'd prefer.

## Syntax theme support

While the Hypest interface is always dark, it will automatically detect the
brightness of your syntax theme and optimize the editor styles to match it. If
you find issues with your particular syntax theme you can change the Hypest
theme settings to always match for light or dark.

> Hypest looks best with the matching syntax themes, [hypest-dark-syntax](https://atom.io/themes/hypest-dark-syntax) and [hypest-light-syntax](https://atom.io/themes/hypest-light-syntax)
